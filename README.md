My To-Do List

A simple application that tracks to-do list items for the user. This app includes functionality to add, edit, or remove list items and utilizes a fluid layout (Skeleton) for different devices and screen sizes. The app was created as an exercise in using HTML and CSS to design web pages as well as using jQuery to manipulate DOM elements.
